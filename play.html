        <h3>A Woman of no Importance</h3>

        <h4>Act 3 - _The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton_</h4>

        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, Gerald.  I
        knew she would come round in the end.

        GERALD.  My mother is awfully conscientious, Lord Illingworth, and I know
        she doesn’t think I am educated enough to be your secretary.  She is
        perfectly right, too.  I was fearfully idle when I was at school, and I
        couldn’t pass an examination now to save my life.

        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value
        whatsoever.  If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is
        not a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.

        GERALD.  But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord Illingworth.

        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don’t be afraid, Gerald.  Remember that you’ve got on
        your side the most wonderful thing in the world—youth!  There is nothing
        like youth.  The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life.  The old are in
        life’s lumber-room.  But youth is the Lord of Life.  Youth has a kingdom
        waiting for it.  Every one is born a king, and most people die in exile,
        like most kings.  To win back my youth, Gerald, there is nothing I
        wouldn’t do—except take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member of
        the community.

        GERALD.  But you don’t call yourself old, Lord Illingworth?

        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am old enough to be your father, Gerald.

        GERALD.  I don’t remember my father; he died years ago.

        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  So Lady Hunstanton told me.

        GERALD.  It is very curious, my mother never talks to me about my father.
        I sometimes think she must have married beneath her.

        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Winces slightly_.]  Really?  [_Goes over and puts
        his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  You have missed not having a father,
        I suppose, Gerald?

        GERALD.  Oh, no; my mother has been so good to me.  No one ever had such
        a mother as I have had.

        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am quite sure of that.  Still I should imagine that
        most mothers don’t quite understand their sons.  Don’t realise, I mean,
        that a son has ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a name.
        After all, Gerald, you couldn’t be expected to pass all your life in such
        a hole as Wrockley, could you?

        GERALD.  Oh, no!  It would be dreadful!

        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  A mother’s love is very touching, of course, but it is
        often curiously selfish.  I mean, there is a good deal of selfishness in
        it.

        GERALD.  [_Slowly_.]  I suppose there is.

        LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother is a thoroughly good woman.  But good
        women have such limited views of life, their horizon is so small, their
        interests are so petty, aren’t they?

        GERALD.  They are awfully interested, certainly, in things we don’t care
        much about
