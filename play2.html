    <h6 class="name lordillingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6>
    <p class="speech">I suppose your mother is very religious, and that sort
        of thing</p>

    <h6 class="name gerald">GERALD</h6>
    <p class="speech">Oh, yes, she’s always going to church.</p>

    <h6 class="name lordillingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6>
    <p class="speech">Ah! she is not modern, and to be modern is the only
        thing worth being nowadays. You want to be modern, don’t you, Gerald?
        You want to know life as it really is. Not to be put off with any
        old-fashioned theories about life. Well, what you have to do at present
        is simply to fit yourself for the best society. A man who can dominate a
        London dinner-table can dominate the world. The future belongs to the
        dandy. It is the exquisites who are going to rule.</p>

    <h6 class="name gerald">GERALD</h6>
    <p class="speech">I should like to wear nice things awfully, but I have always
        been told that a man should not think too much about his clothes.</p>

    <h6 class="name lordillingworth">LORD ILLINGWORTH</h6>
    <p class="speech">People nowadays are so absolutely superficial that
        they don’t understand the philosophy of the superficial. By the way,
        Gerald, you should learn how to tie your tie better. Sentiment is all
        very well for the button-hole. But the essential thing for a necktie is
        style. A well-tied tie is the first serious step in life.</p>

    <h6 class="name gerald">GERALD</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Laughing_.]</p>
    <p class="speech">I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord
        Illingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do. I don’t know
        how to talk.</p>
